        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            If one ever goes to Japan, this is a dish everyone should try. It's very simple and available in most restaurants. It's simply deep fried chicken cut into pieces, hence its name: chicken katsu (cuts). It pairs very well with rice, vegetables, and miso soup.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>Boneless chicken breasts cut in halves, pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>

            <li>flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>panko bread crumbs</li>

            <li>Katsu sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take chicken breasts and wrap in paper towels to absorb excess moisture</li>
            <li>Set aside chicken and prepare other ingredients</li>
            <li>Crack one egg open in a bowl, and beat it until yellow yolk is consistent</li>
            <li>Set aside egg yolk bowl</li>
            <li>Measure 2 tablespoons of flour and put onto a plate</li>
            <li>Measure 1 cup of panko crumbs and put into a bowl</li>
            <li>Return to chicken breasts, remove and dispose paper towels</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper in pinches to season the chicken breasts on both sides</li>
            <li>After seasoning, put chicken breasts in egg yolk bowl, and cover the chicken with yolk</li>
            <li>After covering chicken with egg yolk, place on panko plate and cover chicken with panko crumbs on both sides</li>
            <li>Set aside chicken covered with panko</li>
            <li>Measure 1 cup of cooking oil and pour into frying pan</li>
            <li>Heat stove on medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Wait until oil is ready, test if ready by placing one panko crumb in the pan. If the oil is ready, the panko crumb will crackle and cook. If panko absorbs oil, and sits, oil is not yet hot enough</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts in frying pan carefully</li>
            <li>Cook 3-4 minutes on one side then flip, cooking the other side. Katsu is ready once both sides are golden-brown</li>
            <li>Take chicken out and cut into pieces</li>
            <li>Drizzle with katsu sauce</li>
            <li>Serve with rice and enjoy!</li>
